Version: 0.1.0
Author: Mark H. White II
Maintainer: Mark H. White II <markhwhiteii@gmail.com>
Description: This package contains functions to conduct power analyses for two-way
    interactions in the linear model. It is intuitive by inputting expected mean
    or slope patterns and simulating power from these patterns.
